Filter games temp = value, not working - update - they work, but only when searching within a specific season.  
http://api.cfl.ca/v1/games?key=<key>&filter[temperature][eq]=11&page[number]=1&page[size]=20

When I do "lt" 11, it works, but not eq.


PlaySuccessId - is there a list?

EventType.title - not retroactive

Leaders - overview and detail view don't match for "return_yards", which is listed at the top as "Kick Return Yards"
	- tackles_special_teams does not have a detailed entry
	- returns does not have a detailed entry or a listing at the top
	- kicking does not have a detailed entry or listing at the top - also, this seems to just be punting?  why not a more description name?

Consistency between leaders and team_leaders endpoints - why can't I get the same data from both?

EventType filtered with "In" does not work: 
	http://api.cfl.ca/v1/games/2015?key=&filter[event_type_id][in]=2,3
(only first value matches are returned)

Documentation for all ids?

filters with date eq doesn't appear to work, except birthdates maybe?  
	player 159820 has a game on 2015/06/25, but this url does not work:
	- http://api.cfl.ca/v1/players/159820?key=bOkISuPpdD4OB4XcAcva4qAbtLyuyfwK&include=game_by_game&filter[game_date][eq]=2015-06-26
	even though this url does return that game as the first result:
	- http://api.cfl.ca/v1/players/159820?key=bOkISuPpdD4OB4XcAcva4qAbtLyuyfwK&include=game_by_game&filter[game_date][gt]=2015-06-24

can date filters be combined?  this doesn't work either:
	- http://api.cfl.ca/v1/players/159820?key=bOkISuPpdD4OB4XcAcva4qAbtLyuyfwK&include=game_by_game&filter[game_date][gt]=2015-06-24&filter[game_date][lt]=2015-06-27
