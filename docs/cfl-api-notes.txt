bug - Why does this query fail?
	http://api.cfl.ca/v1/players?key=12345&sort=cfl_central_id&page[number]=77&page[size]=20
When this one works?
	http://api.cfl.ca/v1/players?key=12345&sort=cfl_central_id&page[number]=78&page[size]=20


Documentation errors:
docs error - Players - Additional Data: typo in descriptions (says boxscore is ignored)

docs error - Seasons data is included even when doing a general search (no player id), counter to documentation


Questions:

missing docs- Is there a request limit?  Should be documented.

suggestion - Paging - no indicator of how many players are available, or now many more pages are left.

question - Players - include seasons: how do totals appear when traded mid-season? (See alex hall 143197) - data shows up once per team

suggestion - Players season stat data is inconsistent with game stats:
	rush_yards vs rush_net_yards
	rush_long_touchdowns vs rush_touchdowns_long
	tackles_specialteams vs tackles_special_teams


suggestion - Lookup methods for ids would be useful.  For instance, a resource to get the list of position ids

suggestion - I think team_abbreviation would be useful on the game_by_game objects, to help with players who've been traded mid-season

suggestion - A filter to only download players who have been active on a roster for a given season would be useful.



Questions/suggestions for later:

suggestion - games date_start would be nice as a UTC to avoid timezone complications

question - Will new players always have a higher ID?

suggestion - Would be nice if all entities had an ID property.

kickoff time is not in game payload
game over time is not in game payload
officials are not in payload
roster data does not include positions




------------------------
New

Filter games temp = value, not working - update - they work, but only when searching within a specific season.  
http://api.cfl.ca/v1/games?key=<key>&filter[temperature][eq]=11&page[number]=1&page[size]=20

When I do "lt" 11, it works, but not eq.


PlaySuccessId - is there a list?

EventType.title - not retroactive

Leaders - overview and detail view don't match for "return_yards", which is listed at the top as "Kick Return Yards"
	- tackles_special_teams does not have a detailed entry
	- returns does not have a detailed entry or a listing at the top
	- kicking does not have a detailed entry or listing at the top - also, this seems to just be punting?  why not a more description name?

Consistency between leaders and team_leaders endpoints - why can't I get the same data from both?

EventType filtered with "In" does not work: 
	http://api.cfl.ca/v1/games/2015?key=&filter[event_type_id][in]=2,3
(only first value matches are returned)

Documentation for all ids?

filters with date eq doesn't appear to work, except birthdates maybe?  
	player 159820 has a game on 2015/06/25, but this url does not work:
	- http://api.cfl.ca/v1/players/159820?key=&include=game_by_game&filter[game_date][eq]=2015-06-26
	even though this url does return that game as the first result:
	- http://api.cfl.ca/v1/players/159820?key=&include=game_by_game&filter[game_date][gt]=2015-06-24

can date filters be combined?  this doesn't work either:
	- http://api.cfl.ca/v1/players/159820?key=&include=game_by_game&filter[game_date][gt]=2015-06-24&filter[game_date][lt]=2015-06-27
