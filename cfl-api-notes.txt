Bugs reported:

bug - Typo in Season receiving: "receieve_"


bug - games - date_start filter requires full date and time, makes it less useful, I think, than matching the date and not the time would be
	- actually, I'm not sure if it works at all...

bug - player filter "offence_defence_or_special" equals (any) always returns empty collection
	http://api.cfl.ca/v1/players?filter[offence_defence_or_special][eq]=O

bug - Why does this query fail?
	http://api.cfl.ca/v1/players?key=12345&sort=cfl_central_id&page[number]=77&page[size]=20
When this one works?

Documentation errors:
docs error - Players - Additional Data: typo in descriptions (says boxscore is ignored)

docs error - Seasons data is included even when doing a general search (no player id), counter to documentation


Questions:

missing docs- Is there a request limit?  Should be documented.

suggestion - Paging - no indicator of how many players are available, or now many more pages are left.

question - Players - include seasons: how do totals appear when traded mid-season? (See alex hall 143197) - data shows up once per team

suggestion - Players season stat data is inconsistent with game stats:
	rush_yards vs rush_net_yards
	rush_long_touchdowns vs rush_touchdowns_long
	tackles_specialteams vs tackles_special_teams


suggestion - Lookup methods for ids would be useful.  For instance, a resource to get the list of position ids

suggestion - I think team_abbreviation would be useful on the game_by_game objects, to help with players who've been traded mid-season

suggestion - A filter to only download players who have been active on a roster for a given season would be useful.



Questions/suggestions for later:

suggestion - games date_start would be nice as a UTC to avoid timezone complications

question - Will new players always have a higher ID?

suggestion - Would be nice if all entities had an ID property.

game over time is not in game payload
